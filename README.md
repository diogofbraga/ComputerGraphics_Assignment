# ComputerGraphics_Assignment-
Assignment for Computer Graphics class.

This project was carried out in the second semester of the third year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2018-2019]

The main purpose of the project was to create a graphic engine developed in C++, using OpenGL, able to graphically represent data provided in XML format.

The end result is the presentation of the solar system which contains quite realistic elements capable of representing our solar system and its operation.

This project was developed by me and my colleagues, respectively:
